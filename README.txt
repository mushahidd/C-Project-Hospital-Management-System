								HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM :

The code is very simple to run. There is only one .c file which is the main code and with this file there's two .txt files which handles the data of patients,
1.	ALL_patients.txt 
2.	Patient_data.txt

ALL_patients.txt, this file contains the data of displaying all patients data.

Patient_data.txt, this file contains the all data of patients saved in the end of the code.

you have to put these three main file in one folder which is the basic requirment to run the code.

How to run in cmd?
for compiling : tcc filename.c
for executing : filename.exe

How to run in powershell?
for compiling : tcc filename.c
for executing : ./filename.exe

For running in VS code you have to directly run if you have extensions/compiler of C other wise in terminal the steps are same as of powershell.
